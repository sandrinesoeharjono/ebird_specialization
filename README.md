# eBird Specialization in the CMM
Analysis of Aviary Specialization Changes in the Montreal Metropolitan Community (CMM).

The work was conducted by Sandrine Soeharjono (sandrinesoeharjono@hotmail.com) in 2019 under the supervision of Dr Timothée Poisot (timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca) in the Quantitative and Computational Ecology laboratory (https://poisotlab.io/) at Université de Montréal.

## Study Overview
This study analyzed the effects of urbanization on natural populations through the temporal study of bird dynamics in the Montreal Metropolitan Community between 1990 and 2016. Data from 344 species over 82 municipalities was collected from the eBird database in order to measure changes in Species Specialization Index (SSI) and Community Specialization Index (CSI), demonstrating which types of habitats exhibit stronger biotic homogenization.
